# NLM/NCBI PubReader

This is a suite of Javascript and CSS files for rendering journal articles in a
PubReader view.


## Quick Start

Create a directory that is served by an HTTP server.  Then, from a bash shell with
that as the current working directory:

    git clone https://github.com/NCBITools/PubReader.git
    cd test
    ./make-test-pages.sh

Point your browser to http://<em>location</em>/PubReader/test/test-article.html,
where _location_ is the domain and path of the repository parent directory, as served
by your HTTP server.
